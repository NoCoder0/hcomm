## Description

Converts the virtual address (VA) of a host process into a memory token accessible by CCU hardware. CCU hardware does not directly use process virtual addresses to access HBM. You must first use this API to convert the memory region corresponding to `(srcVa, size)` into a 64-bit token issued by the driver, then pass the token to the kernel function through `kernelArg` or `taskArgs`, and assign it to `LocalAddr.token` or `RemoteAddr.token` inside the kernel.

This API has no dependency on the main lifecycle flow of a CCU instance. It can be called at any time after an instance is created. Typically, a token is obtained and filled into `kernelArg` before calling [HcommCcuKernelRegister](HcommCcuKernelRegister.md).

## Function Prototype

```c
CcuResult HcommCcuGetMemToken(uint64_t srcVa, uint64_t size, uint64_t *tokenInfo)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Input/Output | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| srcVa | Input | Starting virtual address of the memory region. It must be a valid address registered with the driver and cannot be 0. |
| size | Input | Length of the memory region, in bytes. It must be greater than 0 and cannot exceed the actual memory size mapped to the virtual address. |
| tokenInfo | Output | Output parameter, a pointer to a single `uint64_t`. On success, the encoded token value is written to it. It cannot be a null pointer. |

## Return Value

[CcuResult](../../datatype_definition/CcuResult.md): The API returns `CCU_SUCCESS` on success and other values on failure.

| Return Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `CCU_SUCCESS` | Operation succeeded. |
| `CCU_E_PTR` | Null pointer error. `tokenInfo` is a null pointer. |
| `CCU_E_PARA` | Parameter error. `srcVa` is 0 or `size` is 0. |
| `CCU_E_RUNTIME` | Runtime error. `srcVa` is not allocated, or the `size` parameter is greater than the allocated size. |
| `CCU_E_DRV_*` | Driver-layer error. Currently, 4097 (`CCU_E_DRV_INIT_FAILED`) or 4098 (`CCU_E_DRV_BUSY`) may be returned. The driver-layer error code range is defined as [`CCU_E_DRV_START`=4096, `CCU_E_DRV_END`=4224]. For details, see [CcuResult](../../datatype_definition/CcuResult.md). |

## Constraints

- A token is security-sensitive information. Do not print the token value to host logs or device logs.
- `(srcVa, size)` must fall within the same registered contiguous memory region. Crossing regions or covering unregistered memory regions causes the driver to return an error.
- The valid lifecycle of a token is bound to the registration lifecycle of the corresponding memory. After the memory is deregistered, the token becomes invalid.
- In cross-rank communication scenarios, the local token must be passed to the peer through an out-of-band channel (not the CCU data plane), and the peer end assembles `RemoteAddr.token`. The token value must not be transmitted in plaintext over the CCU data plane.
- This API can be called only on the host side, not inside a kernel function body.

## Example

```c
// srcVa is the starting address of the registered HBM memory, and size is the byte size of the memory region.
uint64_t srcVa = /* Virtual address (VA) of the registered memory. */;
uint64_t size  = /* Byte size of the memory region. */;

uint64_t tokenInfo = 0;
CcuResult ret = HcommCcuGetMemToken(srcVa, size, &tokenInfo);
if (ret != CCU_SUCCESS) {
    printf("HcommCcuGetMemToken failed, ret = %d\n", ret);
    return ret;
}

// Pass tokenInfo to the kernel through kernelArg or taskArgs.
// Inside the kernel, assign it to LocalAddr.token or RemoteAddr.token.
```
