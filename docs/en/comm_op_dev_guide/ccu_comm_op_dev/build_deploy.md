After developing a communication operator, you need to deploy it to the operating environment for functional verification.

## Understanding the Custom Operator Build and Packaging Project

The HCCL code repository provides a custom operator build and packaging project. Developers can refer to the [custom AllGather communication operator example](https://gitcode.com/cann/hccl/tree/master/examples/05_custom_ops_allgather/ccu) for development. The directory structure is as follows:

```text
├── build.sh                                # HCCL repository root build project entry
├── CMakeLists.txt                          # HCCL repository root build configuration file
├── cmake/                                  # CMake functions
│   ├── config.cmake
│   ├── func.cmake
│   ├── package.cmake
│   └── makeself_custom.cmake

    ├── op_kernel_ccu/
    │   ├── ccu_kernel.cc                   # CCU kernel implementation logic
    │   └── exec_op.cc                      # Algorithm orchestration logic
    ├── inc/
    │   ├── hccl_custom_allgather.h         # Custom AllGather operator API header file
    │   ├── binary_stream.h                 # Serialization header file
    │   ├── common.h                        # Common type header file
    │   └── log.h                           # Log macro definition
    └── testcase/
        ├── main.cc                          # Test sample source file
        └── Makefile                         # Build configuration file
```

You are advised to organize code files based on the directory structure above. Pay attention to the following key points:

1. Place custom operator header files in the **inc** folder.
2. Place host-side implementation code in the **op_host** folder, and CCU-side implementation code in the **op_kernel_ccu** folder.
3. Adjust the **CMakeLists.txt** file as needed.

## Building a Custom Operator Package

1. Set the CANN software environment variables.

    ```bash
    source /usr/local/Ascend/cann/set_env.sh
    ```

    **/usr/local/Ascend** is the default installation path of CANN for the root user. If you install CANN as a non-root user or in a custom path, replace it with the actual path.

2. Download the HCCL code repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://gitcode.com/cann/hccl.git
    ```

3. Build the custom operator package.

    ```bash
    bash build.sh --vendor=<vendor> --ops=<ops> --custom_ops_path=<ops_project_path>
    ```

    Where:

    - \<vendor\>: Custom operator package identifier, which is user-defined and must be unique.
    - \<ops\>: Custom operator name, which is user-defined and must be unique.
    - \<ops\_project\_path\>: Root directory of the custom operator project, which can be configured as an absolute path or a relative path.

After the build is complete, a custom operator installation package **cann-hccl\_custom\_<ops\>\_linux-<arch\>.run** is generated in the **build\_out** directory of the current directory, where:

    - \<ops\>: indicates the operator name specified by the **--ops** parameter when building the custom operator package.
    - \<arch\>: indicates the system architecture of the current build environment.

## Deploying the Custom Operator Package

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
./build_out/cann-hccl_custom_<ops>_linux-<arch>.run --install
```

The custom operator package installation information is as follows:

- Header file: **\$\{ASCEND\_HOME\_PATH\}/opp/vendors/<vendor\>/include**
- Dynamic library: **\$\{ASCEND\_HOME\_PATH\}/opp/vendors/<vendor\>/lib64**
- Installation script: **\$\{ASCEND\_HOME\_PATH\}/opp/vendors/<vendor\>/scripts/install.sh**

Here, ***\<vendor\>*** is the operator identifier specified by the **--vendor** parameter when building the custom operator package.
